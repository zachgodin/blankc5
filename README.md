# Blank Concrete5 Theme

This repo is a personal Concrete5 (5.7+) theme boilerplate.

## Notes

* Update the description and the thumbnail
* **Must** update the page_theme.php or you can't install it. Casing is important. For ease of use, just name the theme directory one word (no dashes, etc).
* Icons can be downloaded from basically any source. SVG preferred. All icons must keep naming convention and begin with .icon-, using either a span or i element. Icons must also be accompanied by the following attributes: aria-hidden="true" and role="presentation" for accessibility reasons.
* Try to contain all pages within default.php. Setting up seperate page templates should only be done for inner page designs with full width sections or the home page template.
* Do not remove anything already existing in either style.css or grid.css
